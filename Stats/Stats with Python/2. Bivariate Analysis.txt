Investigating associations between two variables:

#################################
CASE 1_ One categorical and one quantiative variable.

0. Divide data into categories of the categorical variable.

Method_1 Using central tendency and spread to assess relationships -
judging differences in central tendencies (mean or median) of categories.

1. Calculate mean and median of quantitative variable for every category.
2. Calculate the mean and median differences between different categories.
	Note: 
	We need to check the differences relative to data spread to intperet it meaningfully.

CCC __Coding implementations:
	getting the means for all categories of a categorical variable (cat_variable)
	realtive to every other quantiative variable
	df.groupby("cat_variable").mean()

Method_2

1. Check total and relative overlap of interquartile range (50 % of data) between categories.
	=> Boxplots help for a quick overview.

Method_3

1. Inspecting overlapping histograms
	Note:
While overlapping histograms and side by side boxplots can convey similar information,
histograms give us more detail and can be useful in spotting patterns 
that were not visible in a box plot (eg., a bimodal distribution, a skew)

CASE 1.2_ Generalizing to categorical non-binary variable with quantitative variable:

Method_4 Pairwise comparison of categories from categorical variable and their respective statistics of quantitative variable.


#################################
CASE 2_ Two quantiative variables

Method_5 

6. Use scatter plots to examine correlations

7. Use Covariance ("Sum of product of coordinates" divided by number of points) and pearsonr (from scipy.stats), to quantify strength of linear relationshoip.
The measures above only indicate if there is a linear correlation.
If there is no linear correlation, or a line with degree zero) both measures are zero. They also result in zero, when data is correlated, but in a non-linear way.

CCC __Coding implementations:
	use sns.pairplot(df) := seaborn makes pairplots for all variables,
				choosing automatically the best option between plots
				scatter, bar, hist

#################################
Case 3_ Two Categorical Variables

Two binary variables:

Method_6
7.1 Contingency tables of frequencies (counts), where datapoints'
row_index displays category of first variable they belong to and 
column_index displays category of second variable they belong to..

7.2 Alternatively contingency table of proportions (divide by total number of datapoints/observations)

	7 Note
Consider the Marginals:
The porportion for respondents in each category of a single question is called a marginal porportion. Suppose, that for one variable one category has over 50% of all datapoints. This means that we can expect higher proportions in the bottom row, regardless of whether the questions are associated or not.

8. Exected contingency Tables
Create contingency table of expected proportions based on Marginals,
for the case of no association between these variables:
	- in each cell for the table, just multiply the values of respective Marginals

9. The Chi square statistic:
Sum of (value_contingency_table - value_expected_table)^2 / value_expected_table
