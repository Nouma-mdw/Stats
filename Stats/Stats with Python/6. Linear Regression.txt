At the end of this module, you will be able to:

Fit and interpret a simple linear regression model
Fit and interpret a multiple linear regression model
Compare models using:
R-squared/adjusted R-squared
F test
Log Likelihood
AIC/BIC
Training and test sets


finding a line wiht the least loss

Givnen that a line ahs the equation y = x * m + b the equation 

for real data is y_ = x * m + b + error

As there can be different lines for every value that the parameters m and b take.
To compare different possible linear models,
we compare their errors.
To compare all errors of one model with all errors of another model in a practical way,
we sum up all errors of one linear model to one single value. This is done with a loss function.
For example the square error function

(error_1)^2 + (error_2)^2 + ... + (error_n)^2

errors also can be called residuals
