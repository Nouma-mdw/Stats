Probability helps to qunatify uncertainty:

1) The union and intersection of two events
--> the envets ocurring in the same random variable or ocurring on two separate random variables

2) The complement of an event

3) Mutually exclusive events

4) Independent and dependent events
--> for events ocurring on distinct random variables

5) How to calculate the union of two events using the addition rule
--> Probability for one or both events ocurring within a single experiment (random variable):
		P(A or B) = P(A) * P(B) - P(A and B)

6) What conditional probability is and how to calculate it

7) How to calculate simultaneous events using the multiplication rule
--> Probability for events ocurring on distinct random variables:
		P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A) [P(B|A) := Probability of B given A happened before]

8) How to use tree diagrams to map out possible outcomes


9) What Bayes’ theorem is and how to calculate it
--> calculating inverted conditional probabilities using the marginal probabilities
	Given: P(B), P(-B), P(A|B) and P(A|-B)
	Calculate: P(B|A) Probability of B given A happened before by
		P(B|A) = P(A|B) * P(B) / (P(A|B) + P(A|-B))
		[(P(A|B) + P(A|-B)) the marginal probability of A]
