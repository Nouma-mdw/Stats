Problems with messy data:

"Inconsistent coding can result in splitting categories (*),
missing data can contribute to inaccurate summaries,
and typpos can make grouping by similar terms difficult."

*( e.g. coding the extracted data e.g. some reserchers measured tree hight in meters and others in yards)

Quality criteria and compromising errors:

I. accuracy:

- consistency in coding: 
	> e.g. some resarchers measure height of trees in meters others in yards but htere is no unit in the record
	> inconsitency in coding owould require to split categories

- completedness:
	> missing data can conribute  to inaccurate summaries (e.g. taking the average, median or mode when data is missing.

- 

1. Noise removal:
	- typos
	- inaccurate data
	- not standardized data (insconsistend method of measurement).

2.missing data (different kinds of missing: 
	> missing completely at Random
	> missing at Random (consistnently missing values based on the  value of another variable)
	> Structurally missing (e.G. no count of fruits for trees with not fruits)

3. Validity of a dataset:
	=> practices comrpomising validity:
	- the use of proxies
	- the use of inappropriate time spans

4. sample and representation:
=> goal of a sample is to represent the whole population. WHen this is not the case we have a sampling error:


5. Datatypes for further processing:

	=> aim is to match informational variables (quantitative and categorical) with datatypes (string and object, int and float) to enable adecuate processing later on.
